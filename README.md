## Purpose of this bot
RBot provides fun and games in your Discord server. With period-prefix commands, you can activate a connect 4 game, a funny sentence completer, and more! I am always updating and adding new features to this bot.

### Functions
#### Number Game
Type .numbers to start a number game. You will be given ten arithmetic questions with 15 seconds to solve each one. Whoever gets the most questions right in the least amount of time wins. Specifically, your score for each question is 0 if you answer incorrectly, and 100/response time (seconds) if you answer correctly. The scores for each question are then summed.
#### Message Completer
Type .complete followed by the beginning of a sentence, and have DeepAI complete the sentence.
#### Connect 4
Type .connect4 followed by a mention of someone else to start a connect 4 game with the other person.

### Code
I have this Python bot hosted as a worker on Heroku.

### What's next?
A function that allows you to restrict a channel to only one word: like the counting bot but better!
